1- can we create a form in side a form?
	Nested forms are not supported and are not part of the w3c standard ( as many of you have stated ).
	However HTML5 adds support for inputs that don't have to be descendants of any form, but can be submitted in several forms - by using the "form" attribute.
	 This doesn't exactly allow nested forms, but by using this method, you can simulate nested forms. (ans from stack overflow post)
	ex:
	<form id="saveForm" action="/post/dispatch/save" method="post"></form>
	<form id="deleteForm" action="/post/dispatch/delete" method="post"></form>

	<div id="toolbar">
    		<input type="text" name="foo" form="saveForm" />
    		<input type="hidden" value="some_id" form="deleteForm" />
    		<input type="text" name="foo2" id="foo2" form="saveForm" value="success" />
        </div>

	The value of the "form" attribute must be id of the form, or in case of multiple forms, separate form id's with space.

2- can it possible to have multiple submit buttons ?
	Using multiple submit buttons in an HTML form allows different actions based on the button clicked. Each submit button can trigger a unique server-side or JavaScript process while 	sharing the same form fields, enabling various functionalities within a single form structure. (Ans from geeks for geeks)

	ex:
	<form action="/DEFAULT_URL" method="post">
    		<!-- Input fields here -->

   		 <!-- This button will post to the /DEFAULT_URL of the form-->
    		 <button type="submit">BUTTON 1</button>

    		 <!-- This button will post to the custom URL of the formaction attribute-->
    		 <button type="submit" formaction="/URL2">BUTTON 2</button>
	</form>

3- how we can submit the form if we don't have input-submit?
	There are several ways to submit a form using JavaScript. Even more, we can also submit a form on some event on the webpage.
	**Submit a Form Using JavaScript.
		The most simple way to submit a form without the submit button is to trigger the submit event of a form using JavaScript.
		ex:
		<script>
    		function submit_form(){
       			 var form = document.getElementById("my_form");
        		form.submit();
        		alert("Your Message Sent");
    		}
    		</script>
